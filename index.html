                <h2>Reflecting on a Blog: Zoom and Human Connection</h2>
                
                <p>Imagine a world where technology brings people closer together, rather than driving them apart. That's the essence of a recent blog post titled <strong>"Zoom: Cultivating Human Connection in a Digital World."</strong></p>
                
                <p>The blog talks about how Zoom, the video communication platform, has become a big part of our lives. It started with a simple idea from its founder, Eric Yuan, who wanted to make it easier for people to see and talk to each other, no matter where they were.</p>
                
                <p>The blog explains that Zoom's success is built on three important things: <strong>trust, humor, and love.</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Yuan believed that for Zoom to succeed, people needed to trust it. This meant being honest and transparent, both inside the company and with customers. By doing this, Zoom became a platform people could rely on.</li>
                    <li><strong>Humor:</strong> Even though Zoom is a serious tool for work and meetings, it also knows how to have fun. Adding features like funny backgrounds and filters made meetings more enjoyable and helped people feel closer, even when they were far apart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Love:</strong> Beyond just business, Zoom cares about bringing people together. Whether it's hosting weddings or helping families stay connected, Zoom wants to spread happiness and love through its platform.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>As someone studying Business Analytics and Information Systems, I find this blog inspiring. It shows how technology can be more than just numbers and data—it can be about people and relationships. By understanding this, I hope to use technology to make the world a friendlier and more connected place.</p>
                
                <p>Sharing this reflection in my portfolio is important to me. It shows that I understand the human side of technology and how it can make a real difference in people's lives.</p>
